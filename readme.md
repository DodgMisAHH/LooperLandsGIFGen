# LooperLands GIF Generator

This is a Python script that processes LooperLands sprite sheets. It takes a sprite sheet and a background image as input, and outputs a GIF animation with the sprites on the background.

## How to Use

1. Run the application:
```
python3 app.py
```
2. You will be asked to input the background image and sprite folder paths.
3. The script will process each sprite sheet in the folder, upscale the sprites, add the background, and combine the sprites into a GIF animation.
4. The GIF animations will be saved in the 'output' folder.
